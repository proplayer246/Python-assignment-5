# Assignment 5: Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains solutions for two tasks from Module 6 of the Python course.

## Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks
- A Python program that stores a dictionary of student names and their marks.
- The user can input a student's name to retrieve their marks.
- If the student is not found, an appropriate message is shown.

## Task 2: List Slicing
- A Python program that demonstrates list slicing.
- It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Then it extracts the first 5 elements and prints both the extracted and reversed list.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run each script using Python:
   - `python task1_student_marks.py`
   - `python task2_list_slicing.py`
